## ⚙️ Implementation Notes
- **HTML5 Standards** – All form fields use proper types (`email`, `date`, `number`, etc.) to ensure validation and usability.  
- **Semantic Grouping** – Sections are separated using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for clear organization.  
- **Accessibility** – Every input has an associated `<label>` to improve screen reader compatibility.  
- **Required Fields** – Critical inputs (e.g., Name, Email, Age) are marked with `required`.  
- **User-Friendly Inputs** – Includes dropdowns for education level, checkboxes for interests, and a file input for resume upload.  
- **Consent Handling** – Newsletter subscription, Terms & Conditions, and Privacy Policy checkboxes are included for compliance.
